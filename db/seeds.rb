# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# User.create!(email: "admin@gmail.com", password: "demo1234", password_confirmation: "demo1234", admin: true)
# User.first.api_tokens.create
# ApiToken.first.update(token: "99484325137985936f276a12ac9d5ac5")
